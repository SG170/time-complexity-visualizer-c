# Time Complexity Visualizer (C)

A CLI-based project built using C to visualize how different time complexities
(O(1), O(n), O(n²)) scale with input size using step-by-step execution counts.

## Features
- Menu-driven interface
- Demonstrates O(1), O(n), and O(n²)
- Beginner-friendly and educational

## Purpose
Built while brushing up DSA fundamentals and strengthening understanding
of algorithm efficiency and performance.

## How to Run
```bash
gcc time_complexity.c -o visualizer
./visualizer
